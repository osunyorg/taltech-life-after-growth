    <p>  <br>Life after growth aims to evolve to an open space for research, sharing, and experimentation around post-growth pathways of collective action and organising. The idea of Life after growth has been initiated in the first Summer School in 2023 and has since been looking for new domains of collective action to spill over.  This page aspires to evolve into a collective space to co-create a common narrative for a flourishing community of researchers, practitioners, activists, and enthusiasts, by gathering stories, experiences, and imaginaries of life after growth, situated in the here and now.  Presently, the Life after growth  Summer School  serves as the main entry point, but we are looking for more and more inclusive forms of connection and engagement. If you are interested to follow the latest updates, share your views and stories on Life after growth, or if you have ideas on how to expand and nourish the Life after growth community, feel free to reach out to us by subscribing to our mailing list using the form below. </p>  <p> Subscripe to the Life after growth mailing list  </p>
