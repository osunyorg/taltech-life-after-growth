        <p>Life after growth aims to evolve to an open space for research, sharing, and experimentation around post-growth pathways of collective action and organising. The idea has been initiated in the first Life after growth Summer School in 2023 and has since been looking for new domains of collective action to spill over. This website seeks to co-create a common narrative for a flourishing community of researchers, practitioners, activists, and enthusiasts, by gathering stories, experiences, and imaginaries of life after growth, situated in the here and now. For the knowing of this world, and the making of new worlds. </p><p>The research and administrative support for Life after growth is currently provided by the research project titled "Exploring a climate resilient political economy", funded by the Estonian Research Council (PUTJD1240). </p>
