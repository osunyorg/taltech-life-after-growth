        <p>Life after growth aims to evolve to an open space for research, sharing, and experimentation around post-growth pathways of collective action and organising. The idea has been initiated in the first Life after growth Summer School in 2023 and has since been looking for new domains of collective action to spill over. This website seeks to co-create a common narrative for a flourishing community of researchers, practitioners, activists, and enthusiasts, by gathering stories, experiences, and imaginaries of life after growth, situated in the here and now. For the knowing of this world, and the making of new worlds. <br></p>

        <p>Life after growth research envisions to explore the conditions for a climate resilient global economy and society. Confronting climate collapse, political economy, as a field of scholarship and real-world practice, faces two cumbersome dependencies: fossil fuels and Gross Domestic Product growth. These dependencies are hindering the conceptualisation and viability of the socioeconomic transformation pathways necessary to address the climate crisis. </p><p>In this direction, the project aims at the investigation, documentation, and feasibility study of <b>Transformative Resilient Practices</b>, defined as unique arrangements of technology, production, and organisation accelerating climate adaptation and mitigation locally, while demonstrating climate resilience pathways globally. Through this, we aspire to contribute to <b>capacities enabling transformation</b> towards climate resilient pathways, within both academia and the real-world practices with which it engages.</p>
