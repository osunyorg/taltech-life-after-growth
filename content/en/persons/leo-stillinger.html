biography: >-
  <p>Leo Stillinger is a writer and filmmaker from Utah, USA, based in Montreal. His work examines the political potential of subcultures, and the transformative possibilities of shared practices. He graduated with an MA in Anthropology from McGill University in 2024, writing a thesis on the culture of long-distance hikers on the Appalachian Trail. His first film, An Urban Wild, examined the meanings of "nature" and "wildness" in a re-wilded park in Montreal; it was screened at the Festival International de Film Éthnographique de Québec in 2023. His poetry has been published in Yolk Literary Magazine. </p>
