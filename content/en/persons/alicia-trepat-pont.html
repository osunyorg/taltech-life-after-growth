In addition to practicing these in her own communities, she has co-authored research on these topics and is currently undertaking a PhD with the Tallinn University of Technology under the Cosmolocalism project led by the P2P lab.<br><br>Her research is focused on emotions in self-organised settings. This builds the foundation of her work on how self-organised teams and communities can be places for personal growth and seeds to transform our socioeconomic system. Since 2014, she has been a catalyst for several social innovation organisations, from social start-ups, NGOs, to a women network, to social movements.</p>
