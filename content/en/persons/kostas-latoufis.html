biography: >-
  <p>Kostas Latoufis received a BEng and MEng degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the Imperial College London (UK) in 2000. Since 2004, he has been working as a researcher with the <a href="https://smartrue.gr/en/alt-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Smart RUE <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> research group of the Electric Power Division of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) in the area of Distributed Energy Resources, and has a PhD from the Fluids Division of the NTUA School of Mechanical Engineering, on Locally Manufactured Small Wind Turbines. He has co-founded the Rural Electrification Research Group (<a href="https://rurerg.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RurERG <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>) of the NTUA, a group which conducts interdisciplinary research with the aim of providing open source technical solutions on small wind and pico-hydro systems for rural energy access. His research interests include off-grid renewable energy systems, axial flux permanent magnet generators, locally manufactured small wind turbines, rural electrification development projects, small wind turbine blade design and science, technology and society (STS) studies. He is an Senior IEEE member, a member of the technical chamber of Greece and a member of the executive board of the <a href="https://windempowerment.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Wind Empowerment <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> association, a global network for the promotion of locally manufactured small wind turbines, and collaborates with other international or national sustainability projects such as the Open Building Institute and the <a href="https://neaguinea.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">School of the Earth <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>.</p>
