<p>The University of Vigo's Post-Growth Innovation Lab is an international, interdisciplinary group with a common research interest: enabling a sustainable, inclusive, and fair ecological transition away from the exploitative economic model that exists today.We believe in democratising science, technology, and innovation structures. We also maintain that if mankind abandons its blind pursuit of infinite economic growth, we can all thrive on this planet without damaging each other and all the other species that call it home.By combining various lines of research, we aim to bring novel, relevant, and multifaceted approaches to some of the most complex threats to our collective future.</p>
