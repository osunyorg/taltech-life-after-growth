        <p>After decades of dogmatising economic growth as a measure and necessity of progress and well-being, the implications for the planet and societies are increasingly becoming hard to ignore. Life after growth aspires to explore the conditions for a climate resilient global economy and society, seeking to re-establish how we value, care for, and nurture our collective affairs in harmony with the human and planetary condition. </p>
