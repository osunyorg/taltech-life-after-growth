        <p>The project’s vision is to explore the conditions for a climate resilient global economy and society. Confronting climate collapse, political economy, as a field of scholarship and real-world practice, faces two cumbersome dependencies: fossil fuels and Gross Domestic Product growth. These dependencies are hindering the conceptualisation and viability of the socioeconomic transformation pathways necessary to address the climate crisis. In this direction, the project aims at the investigation, documentation, and feasibility study of Transformative Resilient Practices, defined as unique arrangements of technology, production, and organisation accelerating climate adaptation and mitigation locally, while demonstrating climate resilience pathways globally. Through this, the project aspires to contribute to capacities enabling transformation towards climate resilient pathways, within both the political economy scholarship, and the real-world practices it studies.<br></p>
