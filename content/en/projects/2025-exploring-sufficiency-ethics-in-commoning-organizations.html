    Exploring sufficiency ethics in commoning organizations

    <p>Relationality and organizational values transcending business as usual  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Sufficiency can be described as focusing on ‘enough’ or ‘enoughness’, representing a shift from producing for increasing human wants to meeting basic needs. By focusing on what is required in society, sufficiency represents a strategy to stay within planetary boundaries while ensuring well-being and a decent standard of living for all. As such, exploring sufficiency ethics in business comes across a conflict of values between ethical considerations, on the one hand, and capitalist economic goals, on the other. Thus, further politicisation is needed to address how organizational values may effectively guide organizational actions and decisions without being subsumed under capitalist motives. That is, economic activity and its organization themselves need politicisation. Commoning as an organizational practice overlaps significantly with the concept of sufficiency. It similarly emphasises relations that are based on sharing and cooperation to enable provisioning based on needs rather than wants. Hence, alternative organizational forms based on commoning provide fertile grounds to interpret organizational values through daily practice and collective action, departing from abstract interpretations of virtue typical of classical ethics. As we are seeking sufficiency ethics in balancing between preferences and limits, the commons create an ontology where this balance is sought in relations of interdependence between organizations and the socio-ecological context in which they are embedded.  </p>
