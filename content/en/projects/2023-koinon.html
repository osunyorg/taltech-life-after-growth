        <p>KOINόN (in Greek Κοινόν stands for "Common") is a cooperative creative economy hub bringing together organisations from the Social and Solidarity Economy active in arts, film and photography, research, and digital editions, with a primary focus on covering their needs in common.   Our values, such as respect, cooperation, and equality, guide our actions as we aspire to create a supportive environment for the community of our members and the broader society. </p>
