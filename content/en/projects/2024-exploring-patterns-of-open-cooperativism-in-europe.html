        <p>This project aims to identify the conditions and potential of an emerging form of organising, synethsising elements of the cooperative movement with innovative patterns of digital commoning. Open cooperativism is an exploratory concept seeking a dynamic balance between the freedom and flexibility of forms of digital work, with the solidarity structures of cooperatives oriented towards the common good.  </p>
