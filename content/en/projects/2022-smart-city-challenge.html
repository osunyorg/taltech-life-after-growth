        <p>The disuse of heritage assets strips cities of potentially usable residential and civic spaces, while it leads to the decay of valuable architectural heritage and loss of collective memory. This (proposed) pilot aims to fuse smart energy optimisation with architectural conservation and citizen engagement, to lower operational costs and unleash the potential of public heritage assets. By mitigating the availability of spaces and energy poverty, the capacities of diverse urban stakeholders can be enhanced and catalysed by local heritage to reinvigorate how we approach urban resilience and sustainable living.</p><p>The proposed solution synthesises smart modelling capabilities with community-driven organisational innovations to improve energy performance of heritage-protected buildings. It entails smart modelling of weather, consumption, and user load forecasts to proactively operate the building, accompanied by Demand-side flexibility to adapt consumption patterns through collective action and community self-organising. Heritage may, thus, become fertile grounds of connections to embodied practices of the past and revitalising more resilient forms of working and living. The proposed pilot harnesses smart energy modelling and forecast as a means of empowering citizens to better anticipate community needs and self-organise.</p>
