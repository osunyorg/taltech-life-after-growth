    Co-production for community resilience
  summary: >-
    <p>The case of Kopli 93 community center </p>
  body: >-
    For this purpose, we present the case of Kopli 93, a community-driven cultural hub and makerspace based in Tallinn, Estonia. Kopli 93 has been developed as an alternative response to the rapid ongoing gentrification of the old industrial city district within which it is situated. In the face of unfettered real estate development and the subsequent pressures of displacement, extinguishing of affordable housing and working spaces, and deepening of the ecological degradation, grassroots initiatives coalesced with the local municipal government to co-produce alternative strategies for urban transformation. In a three-year pilot project they managed to bridge the divergent goals and modi operandi between public administration units and grassroots communities. This alliance bred practices that enable citizens to participate in creative community development and societal provisioning, ranging from food production and distribution, to repair and maintenance services, and technology and innovation development. In the process, they have influenced the administrative routines and policy agenda for co-production by creating awareness on the potential of circular economy practices and local cultural heritage for sustainable and inclusive urban regeneration.
